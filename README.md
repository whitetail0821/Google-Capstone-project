### ðŸš— Google Capstone Project: Salifort Motors Employee Attrition Prediction

[Read this README in Korean ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· (README.ko_KR.md)]

## ðŸ’¡ 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on addressing the critical issue of Employee Attrition within Salifort Motors, a fictional alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.

As a data professional, the objective was to analyze employee survey and work data, build a predictive model for turnover, and ultimately propose data-driven strategies to improve employee retention rates.

## ðŸ’¼ 2. Business Case & Goals

### Company Profile: Salifort Motors

Salifort Motors is a fictional alternative energy vehicle manufacturer headquartered in France. It employs over 100,000 people globally, researching, designing, and manufacturing electric, solar, and hydrogen-based vehicles.

### Business Problem

Recent data indicates a high employee turnover rate. High attrition leads to increased recruitment/training costs, productivity loss, and a weakening of company culture.

### Key Goals

Identify Core Drivers: Analyze factors (e.g., department, number of projects, average monthly hours, satisfaction) that most significantly influence employee turnover.

Build Predictive Model: Design and validate a machine learning classification model to predict whether an employee will leave or stay.

Propose Retention Strategies: Based on the analytical findings, suggest concrete HR strategies and business recommendations to the executive team.

|**Machine Learning**|Scikit-learn|Implementing classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
|**Environment**|Jupyter Notebook|Environment for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model development.

## ðŸš€ 4. Execution Guide (How to Run)

To run the project locally, please follow the steps below.

### 4.1. Environment Setup

Install Python: Ensure Python 3.8 or a later version is installed.

Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries using pip.

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


### 4.2. Code Execution

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the cloned folder.

3. Open the main file, Google Capstone project.ipynb, in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Lab, VS Code, etc.).

4. Execute the cells sequentially to review the EDA, model training, and performance results.

## ðŸ“Š 5. Key Findings & Model Performance

I confirmed that the number of employee projects, recent evaluation score, and tenure are the core factors driving turnover.

**Business Recommendations for Retention**

The following management measures are proposed to minimize employee attrition:

1. Establish Fair Project Distribution: Implement a system for appropriate project load management to prevent burnout.

2. Ensure Evaluation Transparency: Increase the fairness and clarity of the performance review system to boost employee trust.

3. Provide Mentoring & Improvement Programs: Offer targeted support and development programs for low-rated employees.

**This project was completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone.**
